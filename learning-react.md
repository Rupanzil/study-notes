Source: [freecodecamp.org lesson by Hitesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvwq_S0n2pk&t=134s)

## Pre-requisites
- Solid understanding of JS
- DOM manipulation
- Understanding the control of flow in JS
- little understanding of how we import and export modules in JS
- Understanding about bundlers like vite or Parcel. No need to go in-depth. Only need to understand that why we are using these and how these play an important role in making production ready apps

### Topics to read on
* Difference between opinianated and un-opinianated libraries?
  
## The basics
My preferred choice of tool is VITE so, I will be using and telling everything I do using VITE.
React is nothing but a lot of JavaScript written for a library, like any other JS library and we use it to write a lot less code in case we have complex apps.
